Given problem has two modules:

1. Considering the arrival time and burst time requirement of the process, the scheduler schedules the processes by interrupting the processor after every n units of time and does consider the completion of the process in this iteration.

2. Each state of the queue and the table is represented clearly after the ending of each quantum. Moreover, the scheduling of each process is shown with their interval of execution time.

The inputs for the number of requirements, arrival time and burst time should be provided by the user. The inputs for the number of processes, quantum arrival time and burst time should be provided by the user
